Project Management Core Skills
================================
Your role as project manager is to communicate with your stakeholders, clarify objectives, and set expectations. Trust your team to handle the details of each project task & communicate with you when there is an issue. Through direct communication & strategic approach to problem solving, you can provide solutions & help remove barriers for your team. This is where you add value!

★ `Planning & Organizing` - Figure out what the project is trying to accomplish - Gather requirements from teammates or customers - Run kick off meetings - Create project plans - Prioritize tasks and break tasks down into smaller steps - Delegate tasks to team members who can best complete the work - Help move tasks along. 

★ `Manage Tasks` - Help manage tasks for team members - Communicate key milestones to the team or customers - Update all stakeholders on project progress - Follow through on tasks - Hold teammates accountable - Remove barriers for team and project - Conduct standups (what got done the day/week before & what needs to get done today).

★ `Budget & Control Costs` - Keep project on track and within budget: this is a full time-job because the project plan may change causing unexpected costs to arise.

★ `Communicate & Escalate` - Develop a communication plan for the team - Keep in regular contact with key stakeholders - Clearly communicate project goals and expectations, team member roles and responsibilities, and provide constructive feedback - When escalation is required try to approach management with both the problem and potential solution/suggestions.

★ `Build Relationships` - Treat others with consideration and respect - Make the decision making process collaborative: state the goals of specific deliverables and elicit input from the team - Create a safe space for team to feel included and share information - Check in with teammates on how they're progressing & provide feedback on quality - Compromise on new deadlines when they can't complete a task on time - Set up meetings for teammates who don't agree on how to complete a task - Get to know your team and what motivates them to do their bast work. Learn how your team likes to receive feedback & how they like to receive recognition for doing a great job - Pull a group of people together who want to complete the same goal.
                          
★ `Be Flexible` - Project Managers use different tools, techniques, and methodologies everyday - Change is inevitable, the more flexible project managers are the more successful they are - When planning projects, take external events (vacations/sick leave) & holidays into account - Plan for risks & find solutions in advance - Look at historical data & review past projects - Calculate float or slack (refers to the amount of time you can wait to begin a task before it impacts the project schedule.

★ `Don't be afraid to ask for help` ★
