Types of Project Methodologies
===============================

★ `Linear (Waterfall)` - Means the previous phase or task has to be completed before the next can start. 

★ `Waterfall` - Formally approved project plans work well when the desired product is known & understood. Ex – Clear requirements & goals are based on mandated regulation. 

★ `Iterative (Agile)` - Means some of the phases & tasks will overlap or happen at the same time that other tasks are being worked on. Can deliver & test out parts of the project as it’s completed. Gather feedback & make adjustments. This methodology is often used in Agile & Scrum projects. (Link to Agile & Scrum Section)

★ `Scrum (Agile)` - The most popular methodology of agile PM. You form a team that will work together to quickly develop & test a deliverable. The work is completed in short cycles & the team meets daily to discuss current tasks & clear up anything that’s blocking their progress.

★ `Extreme Programming XP (Agile) – Built around simplicity, designing, & releasing a basic product that works then adding features in later. Design, Code, Test (lots of testing), Listen customer feedback.

★ `Kanban (Agile)` - A visual tool to represent progress. Sign board with To-Do, In-Progress (WIP Limit), & Done. With a backlog for tasks to be completed later. (Link to Kanban board)

★ `Lean-Six Sigma (Agile)` - Uses technique of making the team feel valued to motivate them. Streamline processes – Reduces variation to ensure processes are the same every time.

Process improvement – Find where problems are occurring in current processes and fix the using these frameworks.

❤ This technique can be used to solve any business problem 
* Define the project goals & what it takes to complete it
* Measure how the current process is performing & figure out where the problem is & how to fix that problem. – Data Measurement
* Analyze the data – Causes & solutions
* Improve – Present findings
* Control & implement it & keep it there

❤ `6-Sigma 5 Principals`

* Define Value - What the customer wants
* Map Value - Streamline process
* Create Flow - Eliminate waste
* Establish Pull - Pulling on product
* Preserve Perfection - Continously improve

Agile vs Waterfall
================
❤ Agile was created in response to the strict linear process of waterfall.

❤ Agile embraces the reality that the world, customer, markets, & users are uncertain & unpredictable.

◆ `Agile is an iterative process` - Works by using cycles of feedback & improvements to create quality products & improve operational processes. Can take notes on what worked, what didn’t & improve product/processes using feedback for next round/test.

❤ `5 Steps`: 
* Plan
* Design
* Implement
* Test
* Review

★ Agile aims to get customer feedback quickly
★ Working with agile you find ways to work more efficiently by focusing on streamlining processes without reducing product quality or value.
★ Streamline = Reduce Waste
★ More collaboration means less documentation & earlier feedback about the product
