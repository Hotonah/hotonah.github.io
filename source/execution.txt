★ `Manage & Monitor` - The progress – Oversee teams’ efforts & make sure they understand what is expected of them - What tasks need to be done - How & when tasks need to be done – Alert the right people if there might be a delay to the project – Help keep team aware of schedule & deliverable expectations. 

★ `Remove Barriers to Progress` - Breakdown barriers that would slow down or stop the team from completing tasks - Removing barriers is one of your most important tasks as a project manager. But you cannot always do it alone. When your team encounters issues you will write an escalation email to get support & advice from senior stakeholders. `Communication Practices <https://hotonah.github.io/hotonahcom/planning#id12>`_

★ `Communicate` - With your team & anyone else involved in the project through meetings, written communication (emails, memos, chat tools, reports & documents) - overcommunicate. -Daily Standups (Add what they consist of) – Daily Check-ins for status updates, see if anyone needs help on a task/s.

★ `Make Adjustments` - Make adjustments to plans throughout the project as required & make sure they’re communicated to all the correct stakeholders – Address weaknesses in your process or examine places where your team may need additional training – Adapt to changes in the project as they arise.

★ `Follow the` `ROAM Analysis <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/117UM42-K4kooBzD6RjXBIcGeRFMpaQ8WojX1trMVPFA/edit?usp=sharing>`_ - To help your team stay organized you will categorize issues as Resolved, Owned, Accepted, or Mitigated. Knowing how you will handle these issues keeps you on track to complete the project.

★ `Meetings` – Create presentations for your team to keep them informed on the project – To make your presentation engaging & memorable, you will tell a story using key data points, summarize take aways, & outline next steps. – Plan meetings to discuss open issues, after your presentation you will meet & discuss areas to improve as you prepare for launch. To ensure a focused & productive discussion create a meeting agenda that lays out open issues & lists topics for discussion. `Meeting Agenda <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q9S1ftMbQWR-t_ZbA5TXUT3EERFUcIX7x0vqVBRFPBI/edit?usp=sharing>`_

★ `Project Status Reports <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bPNLLhd-P6VL8AQrJgyP4ZcdRr04stt5pvtJ8zmJ1Fc/edit?usp=sharing>`_ - Red, Yellow, Green (RYG) reports improve & simplify communication across the team, keep everyone informed, including key stakeholders. Request more resources & support if needed. Create structure & transparency by recording the project status in a centralized place.

★ `Conduct Ongoing Surveys` - To gain essential feedback from users & improve processes, Implement surveys when possible. `Create Survey Questions <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wU7yTjV3y20btJT6352QCBp5X42vFE6LzYlJOchT-kI/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-m0vPFB9zU_qHHHdNTXTIIg>`_

★ `Conduct` `Retrospectives <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fuprNDHhMpItj9A-S7ywPidrQJ2eEBNVCD_KjMAJPjU/edit?usp=sharing>`_ - Throughout the project or after major milestones – Retros give you a chance to discuss successes & setbacks that took place within the project or phases – Form of process improvement. 

Types of Tracking Methods
========================
★ `Gantt Chart` – Lots of dependencies & used primarily waterfall methodologies.

.. image:: media/gantt.PNG

★ `Roadmaps` - Used for tracking big milestones. High-level tracking of large milestones.

.. image:: media/roadmap.PNG

★ `Burndown Charts` - Typically used by Agile Scrum teams. Burndown charts reveal how quickly your team is working by displaying how much work is left & how much time remains to complete the work. Used near closing when needing to hit hard deadlines.

◆ `Commonly Tracked Items:`

* Schedule – Tasks & Activities
* Status of Action Items
* Tracking Progress Towards Milestones
* Costs
* Risks
* Scope
* Dependencies

Collecting & Analyzing Data
=======================
★ `Six Steps of Data Analysis`

* Ask
* Prepare
* Process
* Analyze
* Share
* Act

◆ `Common types of data PMs collect & analyze.`

.. image:: media/Data_Methods.PNG

❤ `Analyzing Data Benefits in Project Management` - Use data to make decisions, solve problems, improve performance, improve processes, & understand your users. Data defines information you need to know about your project such as, productivity, quality & engagement. The more engaged your team is the more productive they are.

❤ `Become familiar with how to collect data & measure data.` 

❤ `Metric Categories` - Happiness, productivity, quantity, engagement: You can analyze data to predict future outcomes & make predictions about productivity trends, project duration, cost, performance, or quality. Allowing you to proactively manage your project, resources, & measure accuracy if your projections throughout the life of the project.

★ `Prioritize Data` - Need to be aware of the signals that threaten the overall health of the project. A signal is an observable behavior change. Use signals to focus on tasks that have the biggest impact on the projects goal & aligning to your stakeholders’ priorities. 

★ `Data Ethics` - When sharing data with team present in a way that maintains integrity & does not include any PII. Protect the data you collect.

Data Visualization
==============
★ `Dashboards` - Is a type of user interface, typically a graph or summary chart, that provides a snapshot view of your project progress or performance

★ `KPIs` - Is a measurable value or metric that demonstrates how effective an organization is at achieving key objectives. 

★ `Burndown Chart` - Is a line chart that measures the time against the amount of work done & amount of work remaining. 

★ `Infographic` - Visual representations of information such as, data or facts & are typically in the form of what is called a google “one-pager.” They are typically concise summaries of that data. Primarily done through graphics or drawing emphasizing the biggest points with added text for further explanation. 

◆ `Other Data Visualization Tools:`

* `Scatter Plots` – Show Relationships
* `Bar Graphs` – Compare Value, Clarify Trends, & Identify Patterns
* `Pie Charts` – Demonstrate Composition & Shows how much each part makes a whole
* `Line Graphs` – Analyze Trends & Behaviors & Shows Change Over Time

★ When it is time to present you data to your audience, you do not just want to tell them about your findings & what they mean. You want to `show` them. Data visualization helps us organize data & turn it into information that is clear & easy for your audience to digest. Figure out what data you want to show your audience & `why`.

Presenting Data to Tell a Story
=====================
❤ `Step 1` - Define your audience – Know who you are presenting to – figure out what matters most to them.

❤ `Step 2` - Find the data that connects to the question you want to answer – Collect the data.

❤ `Step 3` - Filter & Analyze the data – Once you collect the data you will need to vet it for credibility & filter the information.

❤ `Step 4` - Choose a visual representation – Dashboards, Charts, Mapping, Infographics, Graphs, etc.

❤ `Step 5` - Shape the story – Tie it altogether into one cohesive narrative. Take time to think about what you hope to achieve, the points you want to make, & the questions or concerns you want to answer. 

❤ `Step 6` - Gather your feedback – Do a trail run – Get feedback from someone not connected to the project. 

* Did it make sense?
* Was it interesting?
* What questions did they have?
* What was unclear?
* Make adjustments

★ `Include KPIs` - A `countdown (dashboard)` that shows the number of days until the project launch or a percentage of number of issues resolved. Many dashboards also summarize project plans, documents, & reports in one place & provide visual status of each item. Dashboards are great visualizations for efficient status updates – they enable you to group, summarize, & highlight top project data points.

◆ `Tips for Presenting`

* Speak slowly
* When making a point try elevating your tone of voice for emphasis 
* Pace yourself by using intentional pauses & keep sentences short.
* Make eye contact
* Keep facial expressions warm & friendly
* Be precise, flexible, & memorable 
* Good posture
* Use repetition to help audience
* Have confidence!

◆ `Preparing for the Meeting`

❤ Be clear & specific about what you want to get out of the meeting, frame the discussion with that goal in mind. Tell them exactly what you are looking for & send slides to audience in advance.

❤ If appropriate send a follow-up email with summary notes, action items, & time frames. `Communication Practices <https://hotonah.github.io/hotonahcom/planning#id12>`_

❤ Ask for feedback what went well & what could have gone better? 

Continuous Improvements
===================

.. image:: media/Retro_Framework.PNG

❤ `Conduct` `Retrospectives <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fuprNDHhMpItj9A-S7ywPidrQJ2eEBNVCD_KjMAJPjU/edit?usp=sharing>`_ – Throughout the project or after major milestones – Retros give you a chance to discuss successes & setbacks that took place within the project or phases. You can conduct retros when you miss deadlines, miscommunications, end of sprints, etc. This is a form of process improvement.

* Encourage Team Building
* Improved Collaboration
* Promote Positive Changes in Future Procedure or Processes
* Blameless – Change Perspective (do not use `you` statements)
* Do Not Focus On Negative
* What Went Well (Fun Things)
* Make People Feel Included

◆ `Retro Best Practices`

❤ `Project Summary` - Fill in basic project information.

* Goals & Objectives
* Duration
* Team Members
* Methodology

★ `Also include links to key documents including the project charter, production plan, & scene requirements.`

❤ `Key Accomplishments` - Being the meeting on a positive note by encouraging the team with a list of what went well.

❤ `Lessons Learned` - Team discusses things that need improvement, as well as instances when they were fortunate that went in their favor.

❤ `Action Items` - Turn their lessons into action items where appropriate. 

❤ `Future Considerations` - Ask team to think about next steps in their list & risks that could come up & impede their success. Project manager should take notes on risks & mitigation plans. 

❤ `Resources & Notes` - Retro serves as a reference for how that project went & what was accomplished. Add project notes which the team found valuable.
