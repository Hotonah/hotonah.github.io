Planning the Project
======================
★ `Identify Tasks & Milestones` - sourcing materials, training employees, etc. 

* Milestone: An important point within the project schedule that indicates progress & usually signifies the completion of a deliverable in a phase of the project. To reach a milestone your team must complete multiple tasks.
* Project Task: An activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time to keep the project schedule on track.

★ `Create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)` - Helps understand all of the essential project tasks like, estimating costs, developing schedules, assigning roles & responsibilities, & tracking progress - Use tools like Asana or Tree Diagrams to create your WBS.
