★ `Reference Historical Project Data` - Your project may be similar to a previous project your organization has worked on. It is important to review how past projects were handled including the budget, schedule, project team, roles & responsibilities, risks, & communication plans. Review any past project documents that may help you plan your project, you can even search the web for similar projects to seek extra help. 

★ `Identify Tasks & Milestones` - sourcing materials, training employees, etc.

* Milestone: An important point within the project schedule that indicates progress & usually signifies the completion of a deliverable in a phase of the project. To reach a milestone your team must complete multiple tasks.
* Project Task: An activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time to keep the project schedule on track.

★ `Create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)` - A visual tool that sorts milestones & tasks of a project in a hierarchy. The tasks should be visable in one place with clear descriptions, owners, & due dates. Should also contain detailed milestones & statuses related to the tasks. Helps understand all of the essential project tasks like, estimating costs, developing schedules, assigning roles & responsibilities, & tracking progress - Use tools like Asana or Tree Diagrams to create your WBS.

❤ Develop a `WBS <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qeww1m7-ZvAiO-0xHACCG91aGjbDfR4nxDSBiyM_AWY/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-nmxxXkRTioysq61EcVGvgQ>`_

Project Planning Best Practices
=================================
★ You aren't responsible for completing every task, You're responsible for identifying & helping assign these tasks, & estimating how long they will take to complete. These elements come together to determine the overall project schedule. 

★ It may be necessary during a project to call a timeout: taking a moment to stop and step away from the project to takw a breath & regroup/adjust the game plan. (You may need to take a timeout when the client wants to redefine the scope or if team memebers are reassigned to another project & you need to backfill them. Throughout this you will want to hold meeting in order to discuss successes, setbacks, & possible furture improvements to the project. 

★ Hold retrospective meetings: Focuses on identifying the contributing cause of an incident `without blaming anyone.` You should `always assume that everyone has good intentions & did the right thing with the information they had` whether or not it worked out well in the end. There's always a chance to learn & do better. It's important to identify effective techniques for communicating changes to the team or an individual.

* Carefully review deliverables, milestones, & tasks
* Give yourself time to plan
* Recognize & plan for the inevitable: things will go wrong (Link to Risk Section)
* Stay curious
* Reference Historical Project Data
* Utilize your team, mentors, or manager
* Check, Check, and Double Check!

★ Define `quality standards <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wU7yTjV3y20btJT6352QCBp5X42vFE6LzYlJOchT-kI/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-m0vPFB9zU_qHHHdNTXTIIg>`_ at the beginning of the projet - Well defined standards

❤ Quality Planning - Determine the quality standard & processes to satisfy them

❤ Quality Assurance - Regularly check-in to make sure you & your team are meeting those agreed on standards

❤ Quality Control - Correct any areas that are not meeting the set standards

★ `Implement ways to measure customer satisfaction` - Try to imagine what they want, it puts you in a unique place where you need to put yourself in their shoes & imagine the world or imagine the product through their eyes. Being able to empathize & understand how different people in the world will interact with your product is really important & gives you an amazing perspective.

❤ Customer Feedback Surveys - `Create Survey Questions <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wU7yTjV3y20btJT6352QCBp5X42vFE6LzYlJOchT-kI/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-m0vPFB9zU_qHHHdNTXTIIg>`_

❤ User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

* Present the product
* Mock-up of the product or go through demo
* Collect feedback
* Prioratize & fix any issues

Estimating Times for Tasks
============================
★ How do you estimate the the amount of time a given tasks will take, you do this will the help of your team. Ask team members assigned to the tasks what they think. 

❤ How long does this take?

❤ How complex are the steps to complete this taks?

❤ What are the risks associated with the task?

❤ When do you think you can have this ready?

❤ Negotiate

❤ Ask about their workload, vacations, holidays, etc.

★ `Time Estimation` - Prediction of the total amount of time that it will take to complete a task 

★ 'Effort Estimation` - Prediction of the amount & difficulty of active work to complete a task - ONCE you have this information you need to determine if you have the right amount of people. To do this use a technique called capacity planning.

★ `Capacity` - The amount of work that the people or resources assigned to the project can reasonibly complete in a set period of time. 

★ `Critical Path (CP)` - The list of project milestones that you must reach in order to meet the project goal on schedule. As well as the mandatory tasks that contribute to the completion of each milestone. Your critical path includes the bare minimum number of tasks & milestones you need to reach your project goal. When creating a critical path, focus on the essential, “need to do” tasks, rather than the “nice to do” tasks that aren’t essential for the completion of the project. Here is an example of critical tasks for building the structure of a house:

.. image:: media/cp1.PNG

.. image:: media/cp2.PNG

* List tasks, list dependencies, create network diagram (On CP in red, not on CP in blue), make estimates
* Tasks that happen in parallel
* Tasks that happen secuentially
* Tasks with fixed start dates

`Critical Path Method for Beginners <https://www.workamajig.com/blog/critical-path-method>`_

`Critical Path Method: Project Management Essential <https://www.wrike.com/blog/critical-path-is-easy-as-123/>`_

★ `Types of Dependencies:`

❤ Finish to Start (FS) - Task A must be completed before task B

❤ Finish to Finish (FF) - Task B can't finish until task A finishes

❤ Start to Start (SS) - Task A can't begin until task B begins - Tasks start at the same time & run in parallel

❤ Start to Finish (SF) - Task A must start before task B can be completed.

`Risk Management Plan <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K_8MrxC_qv0IeusNSPIsRgiJzy2BjNf1LYT3VB7_6hc/edit?usp=sharing>`_
======================
★ A Living document that contains information regarding high level risks & the mitigation plans for those risks. Risk Management is an ongoing practice that you will take part in throughout the planning & execution of a project. 

❤ Risk management evolves throughout the project, the plan should be updated regularly to add newly identified risks, remove risks that are no longer relevant, & include any changes in the mitigation plans.

❤ In the risk management document include author, project title, status, created date, & updated date.

❤ Talk with SMEs & stakeholders they may have insight on how to handle these risks with strategies you haven't thought of yet.

❤ Share risks & mitigation plan - discuss better mitigation tatics & new risks.

★ `Types of Risk`

* Schedule Risks
* Time Risks
* Budget Risks
* Scope Risks
* Single point of failure risks - Projects use SMEs to advice you throughout the project. Use multiple SMEs

★ `Risk Mitigation Strategies`

* Avoid - Sidestep or avoid the situation as a whole
* Minimize - Reduce or control it. Mitigating a risk involves trying to minimize the catastrophic effects
* Transfer - The strategy of transferring shifts the responsibility of handing the risk to someone else
* Accept - `Actively Accept` - usually means setting aside extra funds to pay your way out of trouble. `Passively Accept` - is the "do nothing" approach. (Not recommended for most single point of failure risks). It's important to mitigate risks ahead of time. (proactive) - This may save you from needing to accept risks. 

★ `Risk Management Life Cycle`

* Identify the Risk
* Analyze the Risk - Liklihood, impact, prioritize
* Evaluate the Risk
* Treat the Risk - Response plan
* Monitor & Control the risk - Assign team members to track & mitigate risks

★ `Uncover opportunities using Risk Management`

* Completing a milestone ahead of time
* Discounted materials
* Availability of additional resources (people, equipment, investments)

★ `Brainstorm` - Build a decision tree when building mitigation plans: A flow chart that helps visualize the wider impact of a decision on the rest of your project.

* Define the problem
* Identify categories
* Brainstorm causes
* Analyze causes

Project Budgeting Best Practices
==================================
★ `Reference Historical Data` - Your project may be similar to a precious project your organization has worked on. It is important to review how that projects budget was handled, find out what went well & learn from previous mistakes.

★ `Utilize your Team, Mentors, & Managers` - Get into the habit of asking your team to double check your work to give you additional sets of eyes on your documents.

★ `Time-Phase your Budget` - Time-phased budgeting allows you to allocate costs for project tasks over the projected timeline, in which those expenses are planned to take place. By looking at your tasks agaisnt a timeline, you can track & compare planned versus actual costs over time & manage changes to your budget as necessary.

★ `Check, Check, & Double Check` - Make sure that your budget is accurate & error-free. Your budget will likely require approval from another department, such as finance or senior management, so do your best to ensure that it is as straight forward to understand as possible & that all of your calculations are correct.

★ `Categorize Different Types of Costs` - Both direct & indirect Costs.

.. image:: media/Budget_Table.PNG

★ Develop a Baseline `Budget <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R4EAUBBKthNFzKULjDtc6ZR_oMxj7uFKjZJTt_7HDc0/edit?usp=sharing>`_ - An estimate (dollar amount) of project costs that you start with at the beginning of your project. Once budget is approved, you hsould publish this baseline & use it to compare against actual performance progress. This will provide insight into how the project is doing & allow you to make informed adjustments. Continually monitor your project budget & make necessary changes. Update can require the same approval as the initial budget. Re-baseline if you make significant changes.

★ `Perform a Reserve Analysis` - A reserve analysis wil help you account for any buffer fund you may need. 1st review all potential risks to your project & determine if you need to add buffer funds. 

❤ Use milestones as checkpoints for budget.

`Communication Plan <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ysubBfB1k8NgwR-Y3kwXNUFAFvVUrR9sglA6poafgK8/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-fPDA_gUMvP3UdYzfTO9fAg>`_ 
===============================
◆ Identify, Identify, Identify

★ `Project Stakeholders` - RACI Chart or stakeholder map. Who is your audience? Who will need to be informed at different points during the project life cycle?
 
★ `Communication Frequency & Methods` - When & how often? What method do they prefer? How much detail? 

★ `Goals` - Do you need a response? Are you trying to encourage engagement or providing an update? 

★ `Barriers` - Are there time zone differences? Language? Internet issues?

★ `Core Team` - Check in regularly & ask how everything is going. How are they doing on tasks? Do they need help with anything? 

★ `Daily Meetings (if necessary)` - Designed to bring everyone up to date on key information. Here, each team member briefly describes any in progress work, completed work, & any barriers that stand in their way. You can also discuss next steps. 

★ `Key Stakeholders` - Send project newsletters, a brief email that asks three questions:

* What is working in how we communicate with you about the project?
* What is not working or is not effective in our communications?
* Where can I improve our communications with you?

❤ Include a link to all documents within a centralized location

* Recognize & Understand Individual Differences
* Brainstorm & Craft the Appropriate Message
* Deliver your Message
* Obtain Feedback & Incorporate that Feedback Going Forward
* Negotiate 
* Set Communication Expectations
* Empathetic Listening 
* Build Trust by Asking Open Ended Question
* Don’t Overwhelm Sponsors with too Many Details
* Communication Should be Clear, Honest, Frequent, & Relevant

❤ `Writing Emails Best Practices`

* Always Include a Descriptive Subject Line
* Be Clear & Concise
* Be Respectful
* Always Proofread your Emails
* Alter the Subject Line to Reflect New Changes
* Start with a Warm Greeting
* Get to the Point Quickly
* Use Numbered & Bulleted lists or Other Text Formatting
* Summarize Long Emails
* Assign Action Items Clearly

★ It is a project managers responsibility to resolve problems & remove constraints that are a detriment to the project’s success. One way to do this is escalation: the process of enlisting the help of higher-level project leadership or management to remove an obstacle, clarify or reinforce priorities, and validate next steps. Detailing these problems, their potential impact, & the support you need can be an effective communication tool. 

❤ `Escalation Email <https://docs.google.com/document/d/17kxLlcI_pp8iL9TL7z9Z5yEi-ToW6F1OcGwOqgscjfA/edit?usp=sharing>`_ 

* Maintain a friendly & blameless tone
* State your connection to the project
* Explain the problem succinctly
* Explain the consequences – Describe how this issue is negatively impacting the project or has the potential. If it makes sense link the issue to the organizations larger OKRs.
* Make a Request – propose a course of action, solution, or solutions
* State what you need from the recipient 
* Request a meeting

.. image:: media/Escalation_Email.PNG

❤ `ROAM Analysis <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/117UM42-K4kooBzD6RjXBIcGeRFMpaQ8WojX1trMVPFA/edit?usp=sharing>`_

* `R: Resolved` - The issue has been eliminated & no longer poses a problem.
* `O: Owned` - The issue has been assigned to a team member who will monitor it through completion.
* `A: Accepted` - The issue is minor or cannot be resolved, so the team chooses to accept it & work around it.
* `M: Mitigated` - The team has taken action to reduce the impact of the issue or reduce the likelihood of a risk that has not materialized.

Kickoff Meeting!
=============
★ First meeting in which the project team comes together to ground everyone in a shared vision, gain a shared understanding of the project’s goals, scope, & to understand each person's individual roles within the team. This should include team members identified in the RACI chart created during initiation phase. Invite stakeholders & project sponsor. This meeting team members will learn more about how the team will work together to reach the project goals.

* Ask to record meeting if possible
* Ask a teammate to take notes
* Finalize agenda & send to group a day or two ahead
