Starting Initiation
=====================
★ `Organize Resources` - all the information available to you about the project - Determine stakeholders (anyone involved or impacted by the project) - Determine resources, budget, people, equipment/materials, software programs, vendors, physical space, or locations, & other project details. Anything considered needed to complete the project is a resource. Record all these details in your project proposal and get them approved.

★ `Define Project Goals` - Critical tasks - Clarify the details of your project - What you're asked to do & what you're trying to accomplish.

★ `Scope` - This is the process to define work that needs to happen to complete the project - This is also the time to decide what is in scope & what is out of scope (what is not included in the project) - Set project boundaries.

★ `Deliverables` - Tangible products or services that you will create for your customer, client, or project sponsor. 

★ `Select Success Criteria` - These will measure how successful the project was at reaching our goals.

★ `Create Project Charter` - Clearly defines the project & the project goals, then outlines what is needed to accomplish them. The charter sets a framework for what needs to get done & communicates those details to all stakeholders. - See Template (Insert Template Link)

★ `Determine Methodology` - See Methodologies (Insert Link) 

★ `Ask yourself these questions:`

❤ Who are your Stakeholders?
❤ What are the client or customer goals?
❤ What is the purpose and mission of the project?
❤ What are the measurable objectives for the team?
❤ What is the project trying to improve?
❤ When does this project need to be completed?
❤ Whats skills and resources will the project require?
❤ What will the project cost? What are the benefits?

Cost-Benefit Analysis
=======================
Is the process of adding up the expected value & benefits of a project, then compare them to the dollar cost to calculate return on investment (ROI). 

❤ What value will the project create?
❤ How much money will it bring in from customers?
❤ How much money could this project save our organization?
❤ How much time will it save? (Employees, clients, customers, etc.)
❤ How will it improve the customer or employee experience?
❤ How much time will people have to spend on this project?
❤ What are the one-time costs?
❤ What are the ongoing costs?
❤ What about long-term costs?

★ `ROI Formula:`
(G - C) / C = ROI

G = Financial Gain, C = Upfront & Ongoing Costs
