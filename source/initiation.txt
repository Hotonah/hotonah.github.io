Project Initiation
=====================
★ `Documents created in this phase`:

★ `Organize Resources` - all the information available to you about the project - Determine stakeholders (anyone involved or impacted by the project) - Determine resources, budget, people, equipment/materials, software programs, vendors, physical space, or locations, & other project details. Anything considered needed to complete the project is a resource. Record all these details in your project proposal and get them approved.

★ `Define Project Goals` - Critical tasks - Clarify the details of your project - What you are asked to do & what you're trying to accomplish.

★ `Scope` - This is the process to define work that needs to happen to complete the project - This is also the time to decide what is in scope & what is out of scope (what is not included in the project) - Set project boundaries.

★ `Deliverables` - Tangible products or services that you will create for your customer, client, or project sponsor. 

★ `Select Success Criteria` - These will measure how successful the project was at reaching our goals.

★ `Create Project Charter` - Document work: scope, goals, & deliverables - Clearly defines the project & the project goals, then outlines what is needed to accomplish them. The charter sets a framework for what needs to get done & communicates those details to all stakeholders. - See Template (Insert Template Link)

★ `Determine Methodology` - See Methodologies (Insert Link) 

★ `Select Tools` 
❤ Stakeholder Analysis - Determines how & when to communicate
❤ RACI Chart - Determines roles and responsibilities 
❤ Tracking Tools - Plan, track, complete work - Work management tools (Asana, Planner, Trello, Jira)
❤ Communication Tools - Email, Asana, Teams, Slack
❤ Scheduling Tools - MSProject, Google Docs, Smartsheet - Keep project on track

★ `Ask yourself these questions:`

❤ Who are your Stakeholders?
❤ What are the client or customer goals?
❤ What is the purpose and mission of the project?
❤ What are the measurable objectives for the team?
❤ What is the project trying to improve?
❤ When does this project need to be completed?
❤ What skills and resources will the project require?
❤ What will the project cost? What are the benefits?

Cost-Benefit Analysis
=======================
Is the process of adding up the expected value & benefits of a project, then compare them to the dollar cost to calculate return on investment (ROI). 

❤ What value will the project create?
❤ How much money will it bring in from customers?
❤ How much money could this project save our organization?
❤ How much time will it save? (Employees, clients, customers, etc.)
❤ How will it improve the customer or employee experience?
❤ How much time will people have to spend on this project?
❤ What are the one-time costs?
❤ What are the ongoing costs?
❤ What about long-term costs?

★ `ROI Formula:`
(G - C) / C = ROI

G = Financial Gain, C = Upfront & Ongoing Costs

Questions When Interviewing Key Stakeholders
=============================================
❤ What are your most important priorities/goals?
❤ How will this initiative/project support you & your most important priorities?
❤ What role would you like to play within this initiative/project?
❤ Here's how I plan to keep people informed; does that work for you?
❤ What can I clarify for you?
❤ What are your expectations? What would you like for the project to accomplish?
❤ What would success look like for you?
❤ Who else do you recommend I reach out to about this initiative/project?
❤ What information or insights do you have that might be challenging for me to find?
❤ Where do you see me getting support for this initiative/project? Facing resistance?
❤ What additional thoughts/questions do you have?

Setting Goals
================
★ `Objective & Key Results (OKRs):` Combine a goal & a metric to determine a measurable outcome. If you do not know the companies OKRs, remember to ask. The more you can relate your smaller project goals to the companies larger OKRs, the more valuable your project will seem to the company as a whole and they will more likely approve your project moving forward. 

❤ `Objective`

* Defines what needs to be achieved 
* Describes a desired outcome

❤ `Key Results` 

* The measurable outcomes that define when the objective has been met
* These are very challenging goals

★ `When setting Goals set SMART goals:`

* Specific
* Measurable - Identify a metric to determine a measurable outcome
* Attainable - You want the goal to be challenging but not impossible to reach
* Relevant - Relate goal to the companies' larger objectives & key results (OKRs)
* Time-bound - Set a clear deadline

❤ `SMART goal examples`

* Raise Office Greens retention rate by 10% by offering more services by the end of the year. Measure through each quarter. 
* Boost Office Greens brand awareness with new promotions in Marketing & redesigned wbsite by the end of the year.
